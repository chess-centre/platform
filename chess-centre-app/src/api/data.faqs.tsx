        <span>
          A rating is something used to help calculate a players playing
          strength and ability. The higher the number, the stronger the player.
          Players acquire a rating after participating in a minimum number of
          officially timed games. You are given a rating separately for
          Rapidplay and Standard play time controls.

      question: `How long are games?`,
      Answer: () => (
        <span>
          This depends on the event to what time control is used. This can range
          and be different across leagues, individual competitions and event
          types like congresses or rapidplays. Each event will specify the time
          control for the games. Our standard congresses for example has a limit
          of <span className="font-bold">60 minutes</span> on the clock per
          player. Our rapidplays conversly are{" "}

        <span>
          In most cases this means you lose the game. The only exception here is
          when your opponent has insufficient material (pieces on the board)
          left to checkmate you. This would then be a draw.

          This could be for a number of reasons. If an opponent is not rated,
