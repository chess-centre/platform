This project contains the source code of **The Chess Centre** application including configuration for deployment to AWS. Using a "serveless" approach with out-of-the-box Amplify for authentication, data modelling we can connect our UI to our backend resources (GraphQL -> AppSync -> Lambda -> DynamoDb).

## Motivation

**The Chess Centre** was born through a love of Chess and the amazing community it has! This platform serves to provide chess players who enjoy playing over-the-board (in person), with modern, accessible features to easily find upcoming events, register and quickly track results of their real games!

To support this goal, a dedicated centre (physical premises) has been set up for players to come and play. Although there is a cost for members to join, **every single penny** is recycled entirely back into the growth of chess to ensure the beautiful game continues to grow and embrace the new world we live in.

## Objective
  
The project is intended to be as open and transparent as possible, making it easy to reproduce and contribute to. The long term goals include the following technical objectives:
  
- Low cost
    - Infrastructure
- Scalable
    - White-label (independent deployments)
    - Internationalisation
- Feature rich
    - Embracing other chess projects / useful public APIs

### Prerequisites

- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and the npm package manager.
- Amplify CLI - [Download & Install the Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/start/install)

## Getting started

Using git, clone the project (_or fork it_)

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:chess-centre/platform.git 
```

IMPORTANT: Change directory to the root of the React app

```bash
$ cd chess-centre-app
```

Checkout our [develop](https://github.com/chess-centre/platform/tree/develop) branch - this is where PRs are merged pre-live

```bash
$ git fetch && git checkout develop
```

Install dependencies

```bash
$ yarn install
```

At this point you now have everything you need, minus the AWS configuration to run locally.

1. Our current practise is to manually set up AWS IAM users (contact [@matt-d-webb](https://github.com/matt-d-webb) for this), with specific Amplify settings which is used for authentication. Example:

```js
const config = {
  aws_project_region: "eu-west-1",
  aws_cognito_identity_pool_id: "eu-west-1:xxxxx-xxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx",
  aws_cognito_region: "eu-west-1",
  aws_user_pools_id: "eu-west-1_xxxxxxxx",
  aws_user_pools_web_client_id: "123xyz456ABC789dEFg",
};
```

2. The alternative is setting up your own AWS account. _This is advised if you're forking this project for your own use. Steps in the future will be added, feel free to reach out for help, happy to discussed._

Once you are setup with an IAM user, you'll be sent this config which you can add in the app root as `aws-exports.js`

THEN

```bash
amplify env pull dev
```
  
You will now have a custom development environment!

FINALLY

```bash
$ yarn start # app runs on port 3000
```

## Overview

The front-end app uses `create-react-app` and `tailwindcss`. The backend is entirely serverless using AWS (see Architecture).
